# Easy Prompt Selector For ComfyUI

A simple custom node for ComfyUI that loads `ill_hair.yml` and provides
an all-in-one dropdown selector to build a prompt string.

This node is designed for stable and repeatable prompt construction,
especially useful for LoRA training and batch generation.

---

## Features

- Load hair-related prompt definitions from `ill_hair.yml`
- Provide dropdown selectors for all categories
- Auto-select default values for specified categories
- Output a single combined prompt string
- YAML is loaded once at ComfyUI startup (fast & stable)
